# Bird Classifier - CNN
 A Bird Breed classifier using CNN implemented in Pytorch.


The dataset was scraped from Cornell Lab of Ornithology, and organized into folders with each class. It was then split into train and val folders. This project was done to get a better perspective of Deep Learning and CNNs. 

PS- The dataset was too large to be included here.
