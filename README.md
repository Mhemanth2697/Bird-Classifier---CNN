# Bird Classifier - CNN
 A Bird Breed classifier using CNN implemented in Pytorch.


The dataset was scraped from Cornell Lab of Ornithology, and organized into folders with each class. It was then split into train and val folders. This project was done to get a better perspective of Deep Learning and CNNs. 

The PDF contains the static record of the notebook to give an idea of the results obtained.

PS- The dataset was too large to be included here.
